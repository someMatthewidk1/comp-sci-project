    <h1>My life</h1>
    
<p>    When i was a small kid 3-5 i always have been told that i ran around
backwards and into things as a kid, i find that thought funny so i thought i would mention it
After i entered elementary school (mountain avenue) it was just learning a bunch of basics of 
subjects. On my 6th year covid 19 struck and i got covid during december 2019 it was horrible
and i was in the hospital for a week with one lung filled of phelm.
After returning to school for 8th grade i went to LCHS and talked to many many people and even
rick rolled the entire school on a boosted speaker that i brought around. lmao that was so fun.
after making many friends there i wanted to transfer so i could live a more relaxed high school
life without many interactions and thats how i like to keep it. I'm probably going to transfer 
next year to an online school so i can live life how i wanted to for a while.My biggest problem 
is my sleep schedule which matters for in person school while online you can just do the work
when you wake up and i think id have a much more pleasent life with more sleep and more relax
time while still having done my work as i would work faster than the school system teaches.
